# Seat Selector

## Step 1: Planning and Design

### 1.1 Understand User Needs

Start by understanding the user scenarios. Consider scenarios like booking from home on a desktop, on-the-go with a mobile device, or planning a family evening on a tablet.

### 1.2 Define Seat States

Identify different seat states, such as available, booked, and unavailable. This will guide the visual representation of seats.

### 1.3 Sketch Initial Designs

Create rough sketches of the UI for different screen sizes. Consider alternative layouts for smaller screens, like a sector area map.

## Step 2: Responsive Visual Layout

### 2.1 Use CSS Framework

Choose a flexible CSS layout framework (e.g., flexbox or grid) for responsiveness. Ensure the layout adapts to various screen sizes.

### 2.2 Implement @media Queries

Apply @media queries to adjust styles based on screen size. Tailor the layout and styling for different devices.

### 2.3 Develop Different Layouts

Create alternative layouts specifically for smaller screens. This might involve simplifying the seat map or using a sector area map.

## Step 3: Programmatic UI Generation

### 3.1 Define Seat Data Structure

Design a data structure for seats. Consider using JSON to represent seat information, such as seat number, state, etc.

### 3.2 Generate HTML and CSS with JavaScript

Use JavaScript to dynamically generate HTML and CSS based on the seat data. Ensure the generated UI is adaptable to different screen sizes.

## Step 4: Responsive Controls

### 4.1 Alternative Layout for Smaller Screens

Implement an alternative layout, like a sector area map, for smaller screens. This ensures a better user experience on mobile devices.

### 4.2 Adjust Controls for Different Screens

Dynamically modify UI controls based on screen size. Increase button and seat sizes for mobile screens. Implement touch-friendly controls for mobile users.

## Step 5: Interaction Management

### 5.1 Define Seat States

Clearly define different seat states, and use visual cues like color coding to represent them.

### 5.2 Adapt Controls for User Actions

Modify controls based on user actions. For example, change the cursor for booked seats and provide options for selecting, unselecting, and viewing selected seats.

## Step 6: Testing and Refinement

### 6.1 Test Across Devices

Test the prototype on various devices to identify and address usability issues. Ensure a smooth experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

### 6.2 Gather Feedback

Share the prototype with potential users or stakeholders for feedback. Use feedback to iterate on the design and make necessary improvements.

## Step 7: Documentation

### 7.1 Document Design Decisions

Provide documentation explaining design choices, technical details, and the reasoning behind certain decisions. This will help the development team understand the prototype.
